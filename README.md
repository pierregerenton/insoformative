# insoformative
Understand the information gain by the multiple-isoform gene annotation compared to single-isoform annotation.


The purpose of this project is to know, in the context of the EarthBiogenome Project, if it is relevant to spend ressources to produce complete annotation of genome with multiple isoform by genes, or if an annotation with only one annotation by gene is enough informative. 

All script of this project are written to work with an Unix system.
